A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-modded-compatibility).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support, and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch (as well as version ports, that way you can quickly navigate through them on Modrinth).
--------------------------------------------------

## v3.6

The pack now supports 220 mods! Let's go for 300 next lol.

Mod support added:
* Compacter
* Myst Worlds
* Quick Quarry
* Tinkers' Advanced

<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
## v3.3

*I figured I'd add support for a few mods I use that Meï's Additions has broken implementation for (and The Aether Mod since it's a retro classic)*
<br /><br />
*In addition, this update adds support for all the mods Stoneborn: Missing Mods covers. Due to this, Missing Mods is no longer necessary and probably won't be maintained any more (after I finally get around to that backport, at least - might as well do a big final send-off update, right?).*
<br /><br />
Changed the long buttons from Lightman's Currency to use better colours<br />
Changed the Brewing Stand's JEI tab arrow to use the fancy golden one from [Adorn's brewery](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornModdedCompat/blob/main/resource-pack/1.20/assets/adorn/textures/gui/brewer.png) instead of my version
<br />
Imported support for all the mods that [Stoneborn: Missing Mods](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods) covers
- Custom and Masterful Machinery are excluded since pack devs will probably use custom UI textures for them - but they're still in Stoneborn: Missing Mods
- Made Aether support cover all of its UIs (huge thanks to xKeru on the Stoneborn discord for the Life Shard Hearts texture)
- Swapped Quark's JEI influence tab for the one I made for Stoneborn: Missing Mods


## Fixes
- Fixed the inventory and anvil UIs being incorrect. I did report these to the Stoneborn author, but they haven't been fixed yet so I figured I'd toss them in here.
- Fixed Enigmatic Legacy support missing a new UI
- Fixed L2 Artifacts and Backpack support not supporting two new UIs
- Fixed L2 Complements' JEI category being formatted incorrectly
- Fixed L2 Library's UI support not working (I have no clue where they're used though lol)
- Fixed Thermal Series' JEI background having the wrong border shading
- Fixed Thermal Series' JEI fluid arrows allowing fluids to bleed through
- Fixed Traveler's Backpack missing support for several assets that were added in the 1.20 port (reported by mushruuman in the comments section)


## Mod support added
- Biomancy
- Etched (requested a while ago by SumDraco for [Stoneborn: Missing Mods](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-missing-mods))
- Intelligence: Quarry
- Inventory Tweaks: Refoxed
- Item Filters
- Jade (progress arrows when looking at furnaces & such - but it seems like it's not working?)
- L2 Hostility
- Nether's Delight
- Spice of Life: Apple Pie Edition
- Spice of Life: Onion Edition
- Spice of Life: Ringo Pie Edition


### Additions requested by [IdrisQe](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornMissingMods/issues/3)

- Corail Woodcutter
- Enchantment Machine
- Enigmatic Addons
- Enigmatic Delicacy
- Sophisticated Storage
- Wares


<br /> <br />
